# Multipurpose-KeyLogger
I created a Python script designed to run seamlessly in the command prompt, which sends keylogging information to a designated email address. This allows us to monitor how a system is being used by others.

SYSTEM MONITORING USING A KEYLOGGER

Introduction:
In today's corporate environments, data security and recovery are critical priorities. Keyloggers, also known as keystroke loggers, provide an effective solution in scenarios requiring data retrieval or surveillance. These tools record keyboard inputs in a covert manner, ensuring that the user remains unaware of the monitoring activity.

Keylogging applications are especially useful for retrieving data in cases where files are corrupted or lost due to power interruptions or other issues. This project focuses on creating a surveillance tool that logs keystrokes and stores them in log files, which can then be emailed to the administrator. Additionally, this tool aids in recalling forgotten URLs, email content, or other typed information.

In this keylogger project, every keystroke made on the keyboard is recorded and sent to the administrator's email at predefined intervals, ensuring discreet monitoring and data recovery when required.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to monitor and log every keystroke made on a system, then send these logs to the administrator via email. It offers a solution for IT infrastructure requiring data confidentiality and recovery tools, ensuring consistent surveillance and security.
